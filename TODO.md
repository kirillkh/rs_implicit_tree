1. iterators
1. benchmarks of simple (not self-balancing) BST
1. reference implementation + benchmarks
1. comparative performance graphs of variations (with/without filtering, intervals, etc)
1. benchmarks in comparison to typical explicit-array-based implementation
1. full usage example in Readme
1. implement insertion with rebuilding/reallocing when the target index is out of bounds
