A BST (binary search tree) written in Rust that supports efficient query and **teardown** scenarios, i.e. the typical usage
pattern is to build a master copy of the tree, then

1. **clone** the master copy to a new tree
2. tear the tree down with a series of **delete-range** operations (and do something with the retrieved items), interspersed with range queries
3. rinse, repeat

Two variations are currently implemented: **TeardownTree** and **IntervalTeardownTree** (an |IntervalTree|_).

The tree does not use any kind of self-balancing and does not support insert operation.

-------
Details
-------

The tree is implicit -- meaning that nodes do not store explicit pointers to their children. This is similar to how
binary heaps work: all nodes in the tree reside in an array, the root always at index 0, and given a node with index i,
its left/right children are found at indices ``2*i+1`` and ``2*i+2``. Thus no dynamic memory allocation or deallocation is
done. This makes it possible to implement a fast **clone** operation: instead of traversing the tree, allocating and
copying each node individually, we are able to allocate the whole array in a single call and efficiently copy the entire
content.

As to **delete-range** operation, we use a custom algorithm running in ``O(k + log n)`` time, where k is the number of
items deleted (and returned) and n is the initial size of the tree. `Detailed description <delete_range.md>`_.
 
An exhaustive automated test for **delete-range** has been written and is found in ``lib.rs``. I have tested all trees up
to the size n=10.

Usage
-----

As a library
------------
| Add to your Cargo.toml:
|
|     ``[dependencies]``
|     ``teardown_tree = "0.6.3"``
|

| And to your crate's root:
|
|     ``extern crate teardown_tree;``

To run the benchmarks
---------------------
1. Install Rust and Cargo (any recent version will do, stable or nightly).
2. ``git clone https://github.com/kirillkh/rs_teardown_tree.git``
3. ``cd rs_teardown_tree/benchmarks``
4. ``cargo run --release``

I have performed a set of benchmarks, comparing ``TeardownTree::delete_range()`` against

1. ``BTreeSet`` in Rust's standard library
2. |treap|_
3. |splay|_
4. ``TeardownTree::delete()``, which deletes a single element

.. |treap| replace:: ``Treap``
.. _treap: https://github.com/kirillkh/treap-rs

.. |splay| replace:: ``SplayTree``
.. _splay: https://github.com/kirillkh/splay-rs



I made straightforward modifications to ``Treap`` and ``SplayTree`` in order to add support for **delete_range**, however
``BTreeSet`` lacks an equivalent operation (it has an ``O(log n)`` ``split``, but not ``merge``, see
`Rust #34666 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/34666>`_), therefore ``BTreeSet::remove()`` is used instead.

As the graph above shows, on my machine the whole clone/teardown sequence on a tree of 1,000,000 u64 items (we clone the
tree, then delete 1000 items at a time until the tree is empty), is ~20 times faster with ``TeardownTree::delete_range()``
than with ``BTreeSet::remove()``. It also uses 45% less memory.
