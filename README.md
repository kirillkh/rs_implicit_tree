A BST (binary search tree) written in Rust that supports efficient **teardown** scenarios, i.e. the typical usage
pattern is to build a master copy of the tree, then

1. **clone** the master copy to a new tree
2. tear the tree down with a series of **delete-range** operations
3. rinse, repeat

The tree does not use any kind of self-balancing and does not support insert operation.


Details
-------

The tree is implicit -- meaning that nodes do not store explicit pointers to their children. This is similar to how
binary heaps work: all nodes in the tree reside in an array, the root always at index 0, and given a node with index i,
its left/right children are found at indices `2*i` and `2*i+1`. Thus no dynamic memory allocation or deallocation is
done. This makes it possible to implement a fast **clone** operation: instead of traversing the tree, allocating and
copying each node individually, we are able to allocate the whole array in a single call and efficiently copy the entire
content.

As to **delete-range** operation, we use a custom algorithm running in `O(k + log n)` time, where k is the number of 
items deleted (and returned) and n is the initial size of the tree. [Detailed description][1].
 
An exhaustive automated test for **delete-range** has been written and is found in `lib.rs`. I have tested all trees up 
to the size n=10.


Running instructions
--------------------

1. Install Rust and Cargo (any recent version will do, stable or nightly).
2. `git clone https://github.com/kirillkh/rs_teardown_tree.git`
3. `cd rs_teardown_tree`
4. `cargo run --release` to run benchmarks



Benchmarks
-------

I have so far only performed a very limited set of benchmarks, comparing
my own implementation (which is geared for a very specialized use case)
against the BTreeSet in Rust's standard library. Truth be told, the comparison
is unfair, considering that BTreeSet lacks a way to efficiently delete ranges
(it has an `O(log n)` `split`, but not `merge`, see [Rust #34666][2]). That
said, on my machine the whole clone/teardown sequence on a tree of 1,000,000
items (we clone the tree, then delete 1000 items at a time until the tree
is empty), is ~10 times faster with `delete_range` implementation than with
BTreeSet. It also uses 20% less memory (39 vs 50 MB for 1,000,000 u64 items).
You can see the rest of the benchmarks by compiling the project and running
the `benchmarks` binary.
